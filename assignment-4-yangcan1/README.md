# Assignment 4
**Due by 11:59pm on Friday, 3/15/2024** <br/>
**Demo due by 11:59pm on Friday, 3/22/2024**

In this assignment, we'll put the finishing touches on our weather app by using the [Room persistence library](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) to incorporate an SQLite database into the app to save the locations for which the user requests a forecast.  You'll also add a navigation drawer that will display a list of previously requested cities so the user can more easily get the forecasts for the cities that are most improtant to them.  There are a few different tasks associated with this assignment, described below.

You are provided with starter code here that implements a weather app with three screens (a "current weather" screen, a "five-day forecast" screen, and a settings screen) tied together using the Jetpack Navigation Component.  Feel free to use this starter code as the basis upon which to write your code for this assignment.  Alternatively, if you liked your own implementation from assignment 3, you can start with that instead of the provided starter code.

## 1. Use the Room persistence library to save forecast locations

Your first task is to use the Room persistence library to incorporate an SQLite database into your app.  Whenever the user requests a forecast for a new city, you'll save a representation of that city in your database.  You'll want to store two different pieces of data for each city in the database:

  * The name of the city (e.g. "Corvallis,OR,US").  This will be enough to re-query the OpenWeather API to fetch forecast data for the city when the user chooses it in the navigation drawer.

  * A timestamp indicating when the user last viewed a forecast of this city (we'll see in a minute how this is used).  You can represent this as a `Long` value and, when the time comes, set it using Java's [`System.currentTimeMillis()`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#currentTimeMillis--).

To make this work with the Room persistence library, you'll need to define an Entity, a Data Access Object (DAO), and a Database class.

> Hint: there are already several data classes being used in the app, including one representing a city within the JSON response from the OpenWeather API.  However, it will still probably be easiest if you implement a new data class to serve as your Room Entity.  In this new Entity class, you'll just need properties representing the city's name and the timestamp.

## 2. Save the cities for which the user requests a forecast

Next, modify your app so that whenever the user changes the forecast city in the application settings, the new city is saved into the database you just created.  A given city should be stored at most once in the database.  In other words, your database should not contain duplicate cities.  To save cities into the database, you'll have to detect when the city setting has changed and save the new city into the database if it's not already there.

> Hint: You'll probably want to specify [an `OnConflictStragety` in your `@Insert` query](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/room/Insert#onconflict) to make it easy to avoid duplicate database entries.

Once you have your app hooked up to save cities in the database, use [Android Studio's Database Inspector](https://developer.android.com/studio/inspect/database) to verify that the data is being stored correctly.

## 3. Add a navigation drawer to the app

Next, use [the `NavigationUI`](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-ui) to provide [a navigation drawer](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-ui#add_a_navigation_drawer) the user can use to navigate between destinations in your app.  The navigation drawer should be accessable from all of the app's screens.  Initially, the navigation drawer only needs to contain working links to the "current weather" screen, the "five-day forecast" screen, and the settings screen.

## 4. Add a list of saved cities to the navigation drawer

Next, modify your navigation drawer to list all of the cities saved in the database (in addition to displaying links to your app's different screens).  Importantly, you should display the cities *ordered from most-recently viewed to least-recently viewed* based on the timestamps stored in the database.

You can incorporate this list of cities directly into a `NavigationView` if that's what you're using to provide content for your navigation drawer, but you'll have to do this a little differently than the way we specified `NavigationView` content in lecture.  Specifically, in class, we specified the static `NavigationView` content using an XML menu file.  For this app, you'll need to provide dynamic `NavigationView` content based on the cities stored in your database.

Luckily, you can use a `NavigationView`'s [`getMenu()` method](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/material/navigation/NavigationView#getMenu()) to programmatically access and manipulate the `Menu` specifying the `NavigationView` content.  You should use the [`Menu` class's documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/view/Menu) to figure out how to programatically add an item to the `NavigationView` for each city stored in your database.  This will likely be easiest if all of the cities in the `NavigationView` live within their own [`SubMenu`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/view/SubMenu).

## 5. Update the forecast when the user clicks on a city in the navigation drawer

Finally, hook your app up so that when the user clicks on an city in your navigation drawer, the following four actions occur:
  * The navigation drawer closes.
  * The app navigates to the "current weather" screen and fetches and displays the current weather for the location corresponding to the item that was clicked.  For example, if the user clicks "Philadelphia,PA,US" in the navigation drawer, the app should display the current weather for Philadelphia.
  * The "last viewed" timestamp is updated to "now" in the database for the location corresponding to the item that was clicked.
  * The "city" setting is updated to the name of the city that was clicked.  This will ensure that the forecast for the correct city is displayed if the user navigates to the "five-day forecast" screen.  In other words, if the user clicks "Philadelphia,PA,US" in the navigation drawer and then navigates to the "five-day forecast" screen, they should see the forecast for Philadelphia.

There are various ways you could accomplish this.  Again, try to use the [`Menu` class's documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/view/Menu) to figure out how to respond when a city item is clicked.

> Hint: the most straightforward way to update the "city" setting is use a [`SharedPreferences.Editor`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/content/SharedPreferences#edit) (making sure to [apply the changes](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/content/SharedPreferences.Editor#apply)).

## Extra credit: A better way to enter a new city

The flow we implemented above works alright to allow the user to add cities to the database and select them to view their weather forecasts, but the user's experience of having to enter a city in the app's settings in order to be able to select that city in the navigation drawer is a poor one, since the city name must be entered on a different screen than the one where the weather forecast is displayed.

For up to 10 points worth of extra credit, you can implement a better user experience by adding more UI components for fetching the weather for a new city that allows them to enter a city name without navigating to a different screen.  There are a few possibilities here:

  * Add an element (e.g. a clickable entry with a "+" sign) to the navigation drawer that the user can click to [open a dialog](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/dialogs) to fetch the weather for a new city (and add it to the database).

  * Add a [floating action button](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/floating-action-button) the user can use to [open a dialog](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/dialogs) to fetch the weather for a new city (and add it to the database).

  * Use the [Material Design `SearchBar` component](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/blob/master/docs/components/Search.md) to turn the top app bar into a search box.  You can earn an extra pat on the back (but no extra points) if you are able use the `SearchView` component to display search suggestions representing recently-searched cities.

## CS 599 only: Add location awareness to the app

This assignment's challenge for students in the grad section of the course is to make your weather app location-aware.  Specifically, if you're in the grad section of the course, you have one additional requirement for this assignment, which is to use [Android's location APIs](https://developer.android.com/develop/sensors-and-location/location) to allow the user to get the weather for their current location, based on the device's current GPS reading.

You should implement this by adding a "current location" link to the top of the cities list in your navigation drawer.  When the user clicks this link, it should behave like one of the normal nav drawer city links (i.e. navigating to the "current weather" screen), except it should always fetch weather data based on the device's current GPS location.  If the user selects "current location" and then navigates to the "five-day forecast" screen, it should display the forecast for the current location, just like when the user selects a named city from the nav drawer.

## Submission

We'll be using GitHub Classroom for this assignment, and you will submit your assignment via GitHub.  Make sure your completed files are committed and pushed by the assignment's deadline to the main branch of the GitHub repo that was created for you by GitHub Classroom.  A good way to check whether your files are safely submitted is to look at the main branch your assignment repo on the github.com website (i.e. https://github.com/osu-cs492-599-w24/assignment-4-YourGitHubUsername/). If your changes show up there, you can consider your files submitted.

## Grading criteria

The base assignment is worth 100 total points, broken down as follows:

  * 25 points: Room Persistence Library components are correctly defined.
    * 5 points: A Room Entity class is correctly defined to represent city entries in the database.
    * 10 points: A Room DAO is correctly defined to represent the database queries the app needs to perform.
    * 10 points: A Room Database class is correctly defined to represent the database itself.
      * The Database class must implement the singleton pattern.

  * 20 points: New cities entered in the settings screen are successfully added into the database.

  * 15 points: The app has a navigation drawer that can be used to navigate to all of the app's screens.
    * The navigation drawer must be accessible from all of the app's screens.

  * 15 points: The navigation drawer contains a list of all cities stored in the app's database.

  * 5 points: The cities in the navigation drawer are ordered from most-recently viewed to least-recently viewed.

  * 10 points: When a city in the navigation drawer is selected, the app successfully displays the "current weather" screen for that city.

  * 5 points: The navigation drawer closes when a city is selected from the drawer.

  * 5 points: When the user selects a city from the drawer and then navigates to the "five-day forecast" screen, the forecast for that city is successfully displayed.

In addition, the assignment for the grad section of the course has the following additional grading criteria, making the grad section's version of the assignment worth 125 points total:

  * 25 points: The navigation drawer includes a "current location" link that, when selected, displays the weather for the device's current GPS location.
    * Selecting "current location" from the nav drawer should behave similarly to when a named city is selected, i.e. the app should navigate to the "current weather" screen, and if the user navigates to the "five-day forecast" screen, it should display the forecast for the current location.

In addition, regardless of which section of the course you are in, you may earn up to 10 points worth of extra credit for implementing an improved mechanism for entering a new forecast city, as described above.
